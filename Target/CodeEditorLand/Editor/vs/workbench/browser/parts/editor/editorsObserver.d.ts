 * A observer of opened editors across all editor groups by most recently used.

 * - the last editor in the list is the one most recently activated
 * - the first editor in the list is the one that was activated the longest time ago
 * - an editor that opens inactive will be placed behind the currently active editor
 *
 * The observer may start to close editors based on the workbench.editor.limit setting.
